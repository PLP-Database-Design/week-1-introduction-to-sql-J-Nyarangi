## **Question 3: Classifications of SQL**
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines the structure of database objects, e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Manages data within database tables, e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Controls access to data, e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.

## **Question 4: Difference Between Primary Key and Foreign Key**
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for records in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A field in a table that links to the primary key in another table to establish a relationship.

## **Question 5: What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)?**
An ERD visually represents entities (objects) and the relationships between them in a database system.

---

## **Question 6: Advantages of Relational Databases**
- User-friendly interface.
- Reduced data redundancy.
- Easy integration with programming languages.
- Efficient handling of large datasets.

---

## **Question 7: Types of Data Types Used in Tables**
- **String**: e.g., `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`.
- **Numeric**: e.g., `INT`, `FLOAT`.
- **Date and Time**: e.g., `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`.
- **JSON**: To store structured data in a JSON format.
